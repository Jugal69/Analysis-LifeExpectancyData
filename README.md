# Analysis-LifeExpectancyData
Analysis of the Gapminder dataset

1) The data repository Gapminder contains values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007.
2) We analysed the data by breaking this time series down into 3 components(trend,seasonal & oscillation) for all the countries & 
finding out the trend in the life expectancy values.
3) We also studied the effect of GDP per capita on the life expectancy of different countries over time.
4) The data can be obtained here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html
